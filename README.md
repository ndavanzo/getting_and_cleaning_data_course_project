# getting_and_cleaning_data_course_project
Course Project week 3 coursera

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The output of the 5th step is called average_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
